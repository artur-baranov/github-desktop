# GitHub Desktop Practice

This is a GitHub Desktop Practice Repository. 

For the exercises, we are relying on the Replication data for "[Carrots and sticks: How voter loyalty and electoral opportunities shape partiesâ€™ policy priorities in Europe](https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6765.12744)".

The original data repository is maintained by Fabian Habersack on [GitHub](https://github.com/FabianHabersack/carrots-and-sticks).
